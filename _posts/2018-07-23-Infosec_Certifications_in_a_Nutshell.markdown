### The *Entire* Information Security Certification Industry in a Nutshell

You get CompTIA certs for the minimum viable certification to get your foot in
You get CEH because your organization is retarded (and/or government), and you should never be proud of it
You get CISSP because it's the best return on investment (ROI) cert out there, being wanted everywhere and being cheap, but it doesn't teach you much
You get SANS certs because you want the best training you can get along with industry recognized cetification (if a place doesn't know SANS/GIAC, don't work at that place)
You get eLeanSecurity certs because you want *some of the best* training at an affordable price (1.5k vs 7k), and don't mind how rarely their certs are recognized
You get OSCP to prove that you can actually do shit with computers for the least amount of money and the most amount of effort (most respected, entirely practical, cert)
